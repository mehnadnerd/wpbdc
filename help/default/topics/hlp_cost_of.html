    <h1>
       Cost of the Design
    </h1>
    <p>
       The <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span> automatically calculates the
      <span class="b">cost of your bridge design</span> as you create it. This cost is continuously
      updated and displayed on the <a href="hlp_toolbars.html">Status Toolbar.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       The cost calculated by <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span> <span
      class="i">does not</span> accurately represent the total cost of an actual bridge project.
      Rather, the cost calculation is intended to give you a general appreciation for the competing
      factors that influence the cost of a typical engineering project, while also facilitating the
      use of <span class="f4c14">BD</span> for educational design competitions.
    </p>
    <p>
       As it is calculated by <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span>, the total
      cost of your bridge design consists of two major components--the <object classid=
      "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="glos_site_cost.html">

        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
      </object> and the <span class="i">truss cost.</span> The site cost, in turn, is the sum of
      three components: (1) excavation cost, (2) <object classid=

        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
      </object> cost, and (3) support cost The truss cost also includes three components: (1)
      material cost, (2) connection cost, and (3) product cost. All of these cost components are
      described below. The specific numerical cost factors for each are listed in the <a href=
      "hlp_design_specifications.html">Design Specifications</a>.

    <h2>
       Site Cost
    </h2>
    <p>
       The <span class="i">site cost</span> consists of all costs associated with your selection of
      the <a href="hlp_select_project.html">site configuration</a>--the deck height, <object

    </p>
    <p>
       <span class="i">Excavation Cost</span>
    </p>
    <p>
       When you select the deck height, you determine the amount of soil that must be excavated in
      order to achieve the correct highway elevation. The lower the deck, the more excavation is
      required. As in real-world construction, excavation is priced by the cubic yard or cubic
      meter. The <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span> determines the required
      volume of soil excavation, based on the selected deck elevation.
    </p>
    <p>
       <span class="i">Deck Cost</span>
    </p>
    <p>
       Your selection of the deck height also determines the overall span length of the bridge. A
      higher deck results in a longer span, which increases not only the truss cost, but the cost
      of the reinforced <object classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="glos_concrete.html">

        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
      </object> deck.
    </p>
    <p>
       In the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span>, the you can also select
      the material that the deck is made of--either medium-strength or high-strength concrete.
      Medium-strength concrete costs less than high-strength concrete; however, its lower strength
      requires the use of a thicker deck. A thicker medium-strength concrete deck weighs more than
      a thinner high-strength concrete deck and thus will increase the loading on the truss.
      Increased loading will cause the truss cost to increase. Thus a cheaper deck will tend to
      result in a more expensive truss, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
       In either case, the cost of the deck is specified as a lump-sum cost for each 4-meter deck
      panel.

    <p>
       <span class="i">Material cost</span>
    </p>
    <p>
       Structural steel is normally priced by weight (or mass); e.g., dollars per pound or dollars
      per kilogram. Thus the cost of a structure depends, in part, on the total weight (or mass) of
      material used to build it. The <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span>
      calculates the material cost by (1) determining the total mass of the three available <a
      href="hlp_materials.html">materials</a>--carbon steel, high-strength steel, and quenched and
      tempered steel--in your <object classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="glos_structural_model.html">
        <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
        <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
        <param name="text" value="structural model">
        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
      </object>, (2) multiplying the mass of each material type by the corresponding unit cost, in
      dollars per kilogram, and (3) adding these together to get the total material cost. As noted
      in the Design Specifications, each of the three different types of steel has a different unit
      cost. Carbon steel is least expensive; quenched and tempered steel is most expensive. For a
      given material, hollow tubes are more expensive (per kilogram) than solid bars.
    </p>
    <p>
       <span class="i">Connection cost</span>
    </p>
    <p>
       In real structures, the cost of fabricating and building the connections that join the
      members together can be very significant. Thus the <span class="f4c14">Bridge
      Designer 2016</span> includes a cost per joint as part of the total cost of the structure.
      Because the actual three-dimensional bridge has two main trusses, the number of connections
      used as the basis for this calculation is double the number of <object classid=
      "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">

       <span class="i">Product cost</span>
    </p>
    <p>
       In structural design and construction, the most economical design is often <span class=
      "i">not</span> the one that simply minimizes the material cost. Often the total cost of the
      structure can be reduced by standardizing materials and member sizes. If all the members in a
      structure are different materials and sizes, then the cost of ordering, fabricating, and
      constructing those members will be relatively high. If many members are the same, fabrication
      and construction costs will be relatively lower. For this reason, the <span class=
      "f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span> includes a cost per product as part of the
      total cost of the truss. A <span class="i">product</span> is defined as any unique

    <h2>
       Minimizing Total Cost
    </h2>
    <p>
       As you attempt to minimize the total cost of your bridge design, you will find that you can
      <span class="i">never</span> minimize the site cost, material cost, connection cost, and
      product cost simultaneously. Minimizing the total cost is always a compromise between these
      four competing cost factors.
    </p>
    <p>
       To minimize the <span class="i">site cost</span>, you would simply select the site
      configuration that costs the least. But the least expensive site configuration requires a
      simply supported truss spanning a full 44 meters. This configuration will require a
      relatively heavy truss--one with a high <span class="i">material cost.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
       To minimize the <span class="i">material cost,</span> you must make each member as light as
      it can possibly be without failing. For most truss configurations, achieving this condition
      requires the use of <span class="i">both</span> solid bars and hollow tubes in a wide variety
      of different sizes. Minimizing the material cost requires you to use a lot of different
      products and, as a result, your <span class="i">product cost</span> will be quite high.
    </p>
    <p>
       To minimize the <span class="i">connection cost</span>, you must use the least possible
      number of joints in your structural model. But if you minimize the number of joints, you will
      inevitably have a few <span class="i">very long</span> members in your structural model. If a
      long member is subjected to compressive loading, it will require a very large member size to
      keep it from failing. (As a member gets longer, its <a href=
      "hlp_compressive_strength.html">compressive strength</a> decreases significantly.) Thus
      minimizing the connection cost usually results in a high <span class="i">material
      cost</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
       To minimize the <span class="i">product cost</span>, you would need to use a <span class=
      "i">single</span> material, cross-section, and size for every member in your structural
      model. But your single member size would have to be large enough to ensure that the most
      heavily loaded member in the structure does not fail. As a result, many of the other members
      would be much stronger (and therefore much heavier) than they really need to be, and your
      <span class="i">material cost</span> would be extremely high.
    </p>
    <p>
       Clearly there is a tradeoff between the site cost, material cost, connection cost, and
      product cost. Minimizing one <span class="i">always</span> increases one or more of the
      others. Your task as the designer is to find the best compromise between the four.
