       <img src="images/legacygraphics.png">&nbsp;The Second Edition load test animation uses
      game-quality high speed graphics to let you move around the bridge while it is being tested
      and to see what the truck driver sees as she traverses a successful bridge. Some computers do
      not support these advanced graphics. If nothing happens when you select 3D&nbsp;<a href=
      "hlp_load_test3.html">load test animation</a>, or if your computer misbehaves in some other
      way, then you have one of these computers.
    </p>
    <p>
       Fix the problem by restarting the Bridge Designer and checking the menu entry at <span
      class="b">Tools</span>, <span class="b">Use Old-Style Graphics</span>. This causes the
      3D&nbsp;<a href="hlp_load_test3.html">load test animation</a> to be shown using basic
      graphics that work on virtually all computers.
