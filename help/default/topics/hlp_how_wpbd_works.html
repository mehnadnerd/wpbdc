    <h1>
       How the Bridge Designer 2016 Works
    </h1>
    <p>
       The <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span> is intended for <a href=
      "hlp_purposes.html">educational purposes</a> only.
    </p>
    <p>
       When you use the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span>, you will
      experience the engineering design process in simplified form. You will <a href=
      "hlp_how_to.html">design a highway bridge</a> in much the same way that practicing civil
      engineers design real highway bridges.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You will be presented with a requirement to design a steel <a href=
        "hlp_trusses_and.html">truss bridge</a> to carry a two-lane highway across a river.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may choose from a wide variety of different site configurations for your bridge. Each
        will cause your bridge to carry <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_loads.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="loads">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> in a different way, and each has a different <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_site_cost.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="site cost">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object>.
      </li>
      <li>
        You will develop a design for your bridge by drawing a picture of it on your computer
        screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once your first design attempt is complete, the <span class="f4c14">Bridge
        Designer 2016</span> will test your bridge, to see if it is strong enough to carry the
        specified highway loads. This test includes a full-color animation showing a truck crossing
        your bridge. If your design is strong enough, the truck will be able to cross it
        successfully; if not, the structure will collapse.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your bridge collapses, you can strengthen it by changing the properties of the
        structural components that make up the bridge, or by changing the configuration of the
        bridge itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once your bridge can successfully carry the highway loading without collapsing, you can
        continue to refine your design, with the objective of minimizing its cost while still
        ensuring that it is strong enough to carry the specified loads.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       The <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span> gives you complete
      flexibility to create designs using any shape or configuration you want. Creating the design
      is fast and easy, so you can experiment with many different alternative configurations as you
      work toward the best possible solution. The process you will use is quite similar to the
      process used by practicing civil engineers as they design real structures. Indeed, the <span
      class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span> itself is quite similar to the
      computer-aided design (CAD) software used by practicing engineers, and it will help you in
      the same way that CAD software helps them--by taking care of the heavy-duty mathematical
      calculations, so that you can concentrate on the creative part of the design process.

       Good luck!
