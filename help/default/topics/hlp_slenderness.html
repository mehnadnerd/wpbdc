      </object> are difficult to handle on a construction site. They tend to be inadvertently bent
      or buckled during fabrication. The <span class="b">slenderness check</span> is an evaluation
      to reduce the likelihood that this sort of accidental damage will occur.
    </p>
    <p>
       The slenderness check performed by the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer
      2016</span> is based on the American Institute of Steel Construction design code. A member
      passes the slenderness check if its <span class="b">slenderness ratio</span>, <span class=
      "bi">L</span>/<span class="bi">r</span>, meets the following condition:
    </p>
    <p class="in1">
       <span class="bi">L</span>/<span class="bi">r</span> &lt; <span class="b">300</span>
    </p>
    <p>
       where
    </p>
    <p class="in1">
       <span class="bi">L</span> is the length of the member
    </p>
    <p class="in1">
       <span class="bi">r</span> is the radius of gyration of the member cross-section
    </p>
    <p>
       The radius of gyration, <span class="bi">r</span>, can be calculated as

    <p>
       If a member fails the Slenderness Check, it is considered to be <span class=
      "i">unserviceable</span>.
    </p>

       Notes and Tips
    </h2>
    <p>
       In the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span>, the slenderness check is
      performed automatically as you draw a new member or change the cross-section properties of an
      existing member. If a member fails the slenderness check (i.e., if <span class=
      "bi">L</span>/<span class="bi">r</span> is greater than 300), then that member is highlighted
      in <span class="c6b">magenta</span>. If one or more members fail the slenderness check, then
      the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span> will not perform the Load
      Test.
    </p>
    <p>
       To fix a member that fails the slenderness check, decrease its length or increase its
      <object classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="glos_member_size.html">
        <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
        <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
        <param name="text" value="member size">
        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
      </object>. For a given member size, hollow tubes have lower <span class="bi">L</span>/<span
      class="bi">r</span> than solid bars; thus, a solid bar that fails the slenderness check might
      also be fixed by changing it to a hollow tube.

      </object> and member size can be without failing the slenderness check, click the Report
      Member Properties button. The maximum length is indicated by a vertical line that is colored
      <span class="c6b">magenta</span>.

       To obtain the numerical values of <span class="bi">A</span> and <span class="bi">I</span>
      for a given cross-section and member size, click the <a href="hlp_report_member.html">Report
      Member Properties button</a>.
