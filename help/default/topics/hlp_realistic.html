       What is Realistic about the Bridge Designer 2016
    </h1>
    <p>
       One of the <a href="hlp_purposes.html">purposes</a> of the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span> is to provide a <span class="i">realistic</span>, hands-on
      experience that will help you to understand how civil engineers design real structures. Many
      aspects of the software accurately reflect the structural design process; however, a number
      of significant compromises have been made to keep the program from getting too complex. <span
      class="f4c14">BD</span> is intended as an <span class="i">introduction</span> to
      engineering design, with emphasis on the <span class="i">design process</span>, rather than
      the detailed technical aspects of structural design.
    </p>
    <p>
       The bottom line is that some aspects of the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer
      2016</span> are realistic, and some are not. It is important that you understand the
      difference.
    </p>
    <p>
       The following aspects of the <span class="f4c14">BD</span> reflect, with reasonable
      accuracy, the nature of engineering design and the process that practicing civil engineers
      use to design real bridges:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Design is an open-ended process. Real-world design problems always have many possible
        solutions. <span class="f4c14">BD</span> demonstrates this aspect of the design process
        by allowing you much freedom in developing the configuration of your bridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Though design is open-ended, the process is always constrained by real-world conditions and
        restrictions. <span class="f4c14">BD</span> demonstrates this aspect of the design
        process by limiting your design to specific <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_span.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="span">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> lengths and support configurations that conform to the conditions of the project
        site; by limiting your choices of available materials and member types; and by imposing the
        requirement to minimize cost.
      </li>
      <li>
        Design is inherently an iterative process. Because engineers usually work with incomplete
        information, they must often make assumptions, then subsequently check and revise those
        assumptions as the design process progresses. Developing a high-quality solution always
        requires the engineer to consider many different design alternatives, and ultimately select
        the best one. <span class="f4c14">BD</span> clearly demonstrates this aspect of the
        design process. It is impossible to achieve a truly optimal bridge design without
        considering many different alternative truss configurations, materials, cross-sections, and
        member sizes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Design always involves trade-offs. It is usually not possible to find a single design
        solution that best satisfies all design criteria. Making improvements in one area often
        causes unexpected problems somewhere else. You will experience many of these same
        trade-offs when you use <span class="f4c14">BD</span>. For example, as you attempt to
        optimize your design, you will discover that reducing the <span class="i">depth</span> of a
        truss causes the cost of the <object classid=

        </object>). As in real-world structural design, you will need to find the optimum balance
        between the two competing criteria.

        Structural engineering design is regulated through the use of <span class="i">codes</span>.

      <li>
        Structures are generally designed such that they can safely carry one or more
        code-specified loadings. Minimizing cost is also often an important objective--but <span
        class="i">never</span> as important as structural safety. Cost reductions can never be made
        if those reductions compromise structural safety. The formulation of <span class=
        "f4c14">BD</span> is based on this same relationship between safety and cost. In <span
        class="f4c14">BD</span> your design objective is to minimize cost, but a design is <span
        class="i">never</span> valid if it fails the load test.
      </li>
      <li>
        Structural design is often characterized by trade-offs between material cost, fabrication
        cost, and construction cost. When a structure is designed to minimize material cost, the
        design will often include many different member types and sizes. But a variety of member
        sizes makes it harder (and therefore more expensive) to <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_cut.html">

          <param name="text" value="cut">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> and fit the members (fabrication) and to actually assemble them on a job site
        (construction). Structural designers usually attempt to achieve a degree of <span class=
        "i">standardization</span> in their selection of structural elements, even if that means
        over-designing some of them. The resulting increase in material cost is usually offset by
        savings in fabrication and construction costs. The <span class="f4c14">BD</span> cost
        calculation simulates this trade-off with reasonable authenticity.
