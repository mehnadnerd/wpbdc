<h1>modulus of elasticity</h1>
<p>The modulus of elasticity is a measure of a material's stiffness--its
resistance to deformation. A material with a high modulus of elasticity deforms
very little when loaded. Modulus of elasticity is represented by the symbol E
and is expressed in units of force per unit area.</p>
