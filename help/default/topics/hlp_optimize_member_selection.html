    <h2>
       To optimize the member properties:
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Ensure that you understand how the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer
        2016</span> calculates the <a href="hlp_cost_of.html">cost of your design.</a> In
        particular, understand the trade-off between <span class="i">material cost</span> and <span
        class="i">product cost</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Minimize the <span class="i">material cost</span>. There are several approaches you might
        use to minimize material cost; the following procedure is recommended for inexperienced
        designers:
      </li>
      <li>
        Start by using the lowest cost (but weakest) available material--carbon steel--for all
        members.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select an appropriate <object classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="hlp_crossxsection.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="cross-section">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> for each member. It is usually best to use solid bars for <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_tension.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="tension">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> members and hollow tubes for <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_compression.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="compression">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> members. For more information, see <a href="hlp_bars_or_tubes.html">Solid Bar or
        Hollow Tube?</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Now use a systematic trial and error procedure to determine the smallest possible member
        size for every member in the structural model. Starting with a <span class=
        "i">successful</span> design, decrease the size of every member to the next smaller
        available size. (See <a href="hlp_change_the.html">Change the Properties of a Member</a>
        for more information.) Then run the <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_load_test.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="load test">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> again. If any member fails, its size is too small; change it back to its previous
        (larger) size. For each member that is <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_safe.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="safe">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object>, decrease its size again, and run the load test. Keep reducing its size and
        running the load test until the member fails, then increase its size by one. If you use
        this process systematically for every member in the structural model, you will ensure that
        every member is as small (and inexpensive) as it can possibly be without failing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, go back and check if using either of the other two materials--high-strength steel
        or quenched and tempered steel--will reduce the overall cost of the design. Both of these
        steels have significantly higher <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_yield_stress.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="yield stress">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> than carbon steel, so using them will allow you to reduce the size of members
        without reducing their strength. But both high-strength steel and quenched and tempered
        steel are more expensive (in dollars per kilogram) than carbon steel. You will need to use
        trial and error to determine if the benefit of increased strength is sufficient to offset
        greater cost of the high-strength steels. It is permissible to use two or three different
        materials in the same design.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you have adjusted the materials, cross-sections, and member sizes to minimize the
        material cost of your design, be sure to run the load test once more to ensure that all
        members are safe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optimize, based on <span class="i">product cost</span>. When you minimized the <span class=
        "i">material cost</span> (above), you probably introduced a large number of different
        products into your design. Thus, even though your material cost is low, your <span class=
        "i">product cost</span> is probably quite high, and your total cost is almost certainly not
        optimum. Use the following procedure to find the best balance between these two competing
        cost factors:
      </li>
      <li>
        Check the <object classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="hlp_report_cost.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="Cost Calculations Report">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> to see how many products are currently included in your design. In particular,
        identify any products that are used for only a few members in your structural model.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the properties of these particular members to match the next larger (or next
        stronger) available product in your current design. For example, suppose your design
        includes two 40 mm solid carbon steel bars and four 60 mm solid carbon steel bars. Change
        the two 40 mm bars to 60 mm bars. This modification will increase the material cost
        somewhat, but will reduce the number of products by one. This modification will probably
        <span class="i">not</span> reduce the safety of the structure, since you are making the two
        40 mm members <span class="i">stronger</span>. If the reduction in product cost exceeds the
        increase in material cost, the change is a good one. If not, reject the change by clicking
        the <object classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="hlp_undo_button.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="Undo button">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue this trial-and-error process of selectively increasing member sizes (or using
        stronger materials) to reduce the total number of products in the design. Generally, you
        will find that reducing the number of products creates substantial cost savings at first;
        however, as the degree of standardization increases, the cost savings get progressively
        less. Ultimately, too much standardization will cause the total cost of the design to rise.
        The design that minimizes total cost is the optimum.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before moving on to the next step in the design process, be sure to run the load test one
        more time, <span class="i">even if all of your modifications involved making members
        larger</span>. Increasing the size of a member makes that member both stronger and heavier.
        When member weights increase, the total weight of the truss increases. As a result of this
        increase in load, member <object classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_forces.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="forces">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> will also increase, and some members which were previously safe might become
        unsafe.
      </li>
    </ol>
