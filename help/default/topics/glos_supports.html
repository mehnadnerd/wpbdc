<h1>supports</h1>
<p>A support is a joint at which a structure is attached to its foundation. A
truss bridge can have two different types of supports: (1) pinned supports,
which restrain both horizontal and vertical movement of the associated joint,
and (2) roller supports, which restrain vertical movement but allow horizontal
expansion of the structure.</p>
