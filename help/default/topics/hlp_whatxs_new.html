    <h1>
       What's New in the Bridge Designer 2016
    </h1>
    <p>
       The <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span> is a special edition of the
      <span class="f4c14">BD</span> software, developed for the 2016 Bridge Design
      Contest (<span class="u">http://bridgecontest.org</span>). This is the <span class=
      "i">only</span> version of <span class="f4c14">BD</span> that can be used to enter the 2016
      contest.
    </p>
    <p>
       The <a href="hlp_00_.html">user interface</a> and <a href=
      "hlp_how_wpbd_works.html">functions</a> of the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer
      2016</span> are essentially identical to those of the <span class="f4c14">
      Bridge Designer 2013,</span> which preceded it.&nbsp;The only significant changes in <span
      class="f4c14">BD 2016</span> are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      
      <li>
        <p>
           In <span class="f4c14">BD 2016</span>, one of the two <a href=
          "hlp_aashto_h20x44.html">truck loading</a> configurations has changed. The two-lane loading is still a pair
          of AASHTO H25 trucks weighing 225 kN each; however, the single-lane permit loading now
          weighs 480 kN. The AASHTO truck loading has a heavy axle and a lighter axle, while the permit loading uses equal axle loads.
          Both loadings use a dynamic load allowance of 1.33. As a result of this
          change, it is not clear which of the two load configurations is more severe.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="f4c14">BD 2016</span> uses new cost factors to calculate the <a href=
        "hlp_cost_of.html">cost of your design</a>. Thus the costs of bridges designed with BD
        2016 have no comparability with the costs of bridges designed with earlier versions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           <span class="f4c14">BD 2016</span> allows for both four-character and six-character
          Local Contest Codes, to be used in conjunction with the <span class="b">Bridge
          Design Contest</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
