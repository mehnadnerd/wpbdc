       Notes and Tips
    </h2>
    <p>
       To understand why the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span> would not
      be an appropriate tool for designing a real bridge, see <a href="hlp_not_realistic.html">What
      is Not Realistic about BD.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       If you need to design a real bridge, you <span class="i">must</span> obtain the services of
      a registered professional civil engineer. To do anything less would be irresponsible.
