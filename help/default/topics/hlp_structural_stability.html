       Structural Stability
    </h1>
    <p>
       A truss is <span class="b">stable</span> if all of its <object classid=
      "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="glos_members.html">
        <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
        <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
        <param name="text" value="members">
        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
      </object> are interconnected as a rigid framework. Stability is usually achieved by ensuring
      that the truss is composed of interconnected triangles. For example, the simple truss below
      is composed of 6 <object classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="glos_joints.html">
        <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
        <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
        <param name="text" value="joints">
        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
      </object> and 9 members, which together form four interconnected triangles (<span class=
      "c5">ABF</span>, <span class="c5">BCF</span>, <span class="c5">CEF</span>, and <span class=
      "c5">CDE</span>).
    </p>
    <p class="in1">
       <img src="images/stab1.png" alt="Structural Stability" border="0">
    </p>
    <p>
       If member <span class="c5">CF</span> is removed, however, the truss becomes unstable.
    </p>
    <p class="in1">
       <img src="images/stab2.png" alt="Structural Stability" border="0">
    </p>
    <p>
       Without its diagonal member, the center panel of the truss now consists of a rectangle
      (<span class="c5">BCEF</span>) formed by four members, rather than two triangles (<span
      class="c5">BCF</span> and <span class="c5">CEF</span>). This configuration is unstable
      because there is nothing to prevent the rectangle <span class="c5">BCEF</span> from
      distorting into a parallelogram, as shown below:
    </p>
    <p class="in1">
       <img src="images/stab3.png" alt="Structural Stability" border="0">
    </p>
    <p>
       The triangular arrangement of members ensures that the truss structure is a rigid framework.
    </p>
    <p>
       To fix an unstable truss, look for any "panel" of the <object classid=
      "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="glos_structural_model.html">
        <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
        <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
        <param name="text" value="structural model">
        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
      </object> that is not a triangle, then add one or more members to transform that panel into a
      series of interconnected triangular shapes.

       Notes and Tips
    </h2>
    <p>
       If you are having trouble creating a stable structural model, try <a href=
      "hlp_load_a_template.html">loading a template</a> and using it as a guide for drawing joints
      and members.
    </p>
    <p>
       If an actual structure is unstable, it will collapse. If a structural model is unstable, the
      <object classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="glos_structural_analysis.html">
        <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
        <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
        <param name="text" value="structural analysis">
        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
      </object> is mathematically impossible. (The computer will attempt to divide by zero.)
    </p>
    <p>
       If your structural model is unstable, the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer
      2016</span> will detect and attempt to fix the instability during the <a href=
      "hlp_run_load_test.html">Load Test</a>. If the attempted fix is unsuccessful, <span class=
      "f4c14">BD 2016</span> will display a warning message, and you will have to return to the
      <a href="hlp_00x_picloadtest.html">Drawing Board</a> and modify your structural model to
      eliminate the instability.
    </p>
    <p>
       Though most trusses are composed of interconnected triangles, it is possible to have one or
      more non-triangular panels in a stable truss. This is particularly true for complex truss
      configurations and for trusses with <object classid=
      "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="glos_arch_supports.html">
        <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
        <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
        <param name="text" value="arch supports">
        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
      </object>. In such cases, you probably won't be able to tell whether or not the truss is
      stable just by looking at it. The ultimate test for stability is to run the Load Test. If the
      Load Test runs without displaying the "your structural model is unstable" warning, then your
      truss is stable.
