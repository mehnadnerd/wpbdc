<h1>Title Block</h1>
<p>The <span class="b">Title Block</span> is located in the lower right-hand
corner of the <a href="hlp_00x_picloadtest.html">Drawing Board.</a> It shows
the name of the bridge design project, the name of the designer, and a project
identification (or project ID). The name of the designer is optional. If you
provide it, it will be shown in the title block and included on all printed
output.</p>
<h2 class="btop">Notes and Tips</h2>
<p>The project ID consists of two parts, separated by a dash. The first part is
the six-character Local Contest Code (if you entered a Local Contest Code when
you started your design). This part of the project ID cannot be changed. The
second part is optional and can be any name or number that helps you identify
your design.</p>
<p>When you start a new design, the <a href="hlp_drawing_board.html">Design
Project Setup Wizard</a> will prompt you for the designer's name and a project
ID.</p>
<p>If you want to enter or change the designer's name or the project ID after
you have begun your design, just click the appropriate box in the Title Block.
When the cursor appears, type or edit the desired text.</p>
<p>You can hide or display the Title Block using the <object classid=
"java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer"><param name="content" value=
"hlp_view_title.html">
<param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
<param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
<param name="text" value="View Title Block button.">
<param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup"></object></p>
<p>When the <a href="hlp_member_list.html">Member List</a> is displayed, it may
hide all or part of the Title Block.</p>
