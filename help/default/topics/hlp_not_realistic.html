       What is Not Realistic About the Bridge Designer 2016
    </h1>
    <p>
      One of the <a href="hlp_purposes.html">purposes</a> of the <span class="f4c14">Bridge 
      Designer 2016</span> is to provide a <span class="i">realistic</span>, hands-on
      experience that will help you to understand how civil engineers design real structures. Many
      aspects of the software accurately reflect the structural design process; however, a number
      of significant compromises have been made to keep the program from getting too complex. <span
      class="f4c14">BD</span> is intended as an <span class="i">introduction</span> to
      engineering design, with emphasis on the <span class="i">design process</span>, rather than
      the detailed technical aspects of structural design.
    </p>
    <p>
       The bottom line is that some aspects of the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer
      2016</span> are realistic, and some are not. It is important that you understand the
      difference.
    </p>
    <p>
       The following aspects of the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span>
      <span class="i">do not</span> accurately reflect the process that practicing civil engineers
      use to design real bridges:

        In designing an actual bridge, engineers must developed detailed designs and cost estimates

          <param name="text" value="members">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object>. Engineers would also need to consider the environmental impact of the bridge and
        the effects of water and ice in the river channel as an integral part of the design. In
        <span class="f4c14">BD</span> you only design the main trusses and make some preliminary
        decisions about the configurations of the roadway and supports. The design is strictly
        two-dimensional and thus does not account for three-dimensional stability.
      </li>
      <li>
        In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider the effects of <span class=
        "i">fatigue</span>--the tendency of a structural material to fail prematurely as a result
        of the repetitive loading caused by vehicular traffic. <span class="f4c14">BD</span> does
        not consider fatigue.
      </li>
      <li>
        In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider many different types of loading, to
        include several different forms of vehicular <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_loads.html">

          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object>, self-weight, wind, snow, collision by vehicles and ships, and earthquakes. They
        must consider both the longitudinal and lateral position of the vehicular loads on the
        bridge deck. They must also consider numerous <a href="hlp_load_combinations.html">load
        combinations</a>--eleven in the 1994 <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">

          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="AASHTO">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> Bridge Design Specification. <span class="f4c14">BD</span> considers only two
        types of vehicular loading and the self-weight of the bridge. It considers only the
        longitudinal position of the vehicular loading, not the lateral position.
      </li>
      <li>
        In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider limitations on <span class=
        "i">deflections</span>--the amount of bending that occurs when a vehicle crosses the
        bridge. <span class="f4c14">BD</span> calculates deflections and displays them during the
        <object classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_load_test.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">

        </object>, but does not use them as a design criterion.
      </li>
      <li>
        In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider many additional member failure modes
        not considered by the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <span class="f4c14">BD</span> load test, the <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="hlp_aashto_h20x44.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">

          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> represents two lanes of highway traffic, and this loading is moved across the
        bridge in one direction--from left to right. The AASHTO loading has a heavy rear
        axle and a lighter front axle. Because this loading is asymmetrical, an optimally designed bridge
        might be asymmetrical as well. However, the design of real bridges must consider the movement of the AASHTO loading in <span class=
        "i">both</span> directions--left to right <span class="i">and</span> right to left. As a result, optimally designed
        real-world bridges are generally symmetrical.
      </li>
      <li>
        Though <span class="f4c14">BD</span> attempts to accurately demonstrate the cost
        tradeoffs inherent in engineering design, the actual costs of the structural materials and
        components used in the software are not intended to be accurate. <span class=
        "f4c14">BD</span> is used as the vehicle for a national educational design competition
        and, to some extent, its cost factors are dictated by the needs of the competition.
      </li>
      <li>
        In designing an actual bridge, engineers must consider <span class="i">esthetics</span>.
        <span class="f4c14">BD</span> does not include esthetics as a design criterion (though
        you can certainly set a personal goal to design only good-looking bridges!)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       It is important to recognize that these limitations exist. But it is equally important to
      understand <a href="hlp_realistic.html">what is realistic about the Bridge
      Designer.</a>
