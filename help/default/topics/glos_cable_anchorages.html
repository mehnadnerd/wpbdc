<h1>cable anchorages</h1>
<p>A cable anchorage is a foundation structure to which the cables of a
suspension bridge are connected. Because the cables support most of the weight
of a suspension bridge, anchorages are generally very massive and often extend
far below the surface of the earth. In the Bridge Designer, cable
anchorages are represented by pinned supports.</p>
