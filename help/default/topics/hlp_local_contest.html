    <h1>
       Local Contest Code
    </h1>
    <p>
      The Bridge Design Contest (BDC) includes support for two different types of local
      bridge design contests.  
      In either case, a contest code is issued to the local contest organizer 
      by the national BDC Coordinator.  
      The first type, which uses a <span class="b">4-character
      Local Contest Code</span>, is best when the national BDC is in progress.
      Any bridge submitted to the local contest simultaneously competes in
      the national contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <span class="b">6-character Local Contest Code</span> is restricted to a 
      single site configuration and load case.  
      The designated site configuration and load case are embedded in the Local Contest Code.  
      For this reason, the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer
      2016</span> allows the user to input a six-character Local Contest Code at the 
      start of each new design.
      Local Contest Code entry is included as Step 2 in the <a href="hlp_drawing_board.html">Design
      Project Setup Wizard</a>.The advantage of a 6-character contest
      is that students quickly
      produce competitive bridges for the single site. A disadvantage occurs 
      if the national BDC is in progress: Bridges designed for the local contest 
      are unlikely to be competitive nationally due to the site restriction.</p>

       To enter a Local Contest Code:
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Click the <object classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="hlp_new_design.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">

          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> to display the <a href="hlp_drawing_board.html">Design Project Setup Wizard</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        At Step 2 in the Wizard, check <span class="b">Yes</span> to indicate which type of Local Contest Code (4-character or 6-character) you will be using.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are using a 6-character Local Contest Code, enter it in the text box.

       Notes and Tips
    </h2>
    <p>
       The first three characters of a 6-character Local Contest Code uniquely
      identify the local contest (e.g., NHS for Northampton High School). The next two characters
      are a two-digit number representing the site configuration (i.e., the <object classid=
      "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="glos_deck.html">
        <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
        <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
        <param name="text" value="deck">
        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
      </object> elevation and supports). The final character is a letter (A, B, C, or D)
      designating the Load Case. The load case consists of one of the two truck available loadings
      combined with one of the two available <object classid=
      "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="glos_concrete.html">
        <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
        <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
        <param name="text" value="concrete">
        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
      </object> deck thicknesses.
    </p>
    <p>
       As soon as a valid 6-character Local Contest Code is entered in the Design Project Setup Wizard, the
      corresponding site configuration and load case are displayed in the Preview window.
