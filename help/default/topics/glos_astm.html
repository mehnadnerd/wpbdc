<h1>ASTM</h1>
<p>The American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) is a not-for-profit
organization, through which manufacturers, consumers, researchers, and
government officials write standards for the production, testing, and use of
building materials. ASTM standards ensure that all materials have uniformly
understood engineering properties and an appropriate level of quality.</p>
