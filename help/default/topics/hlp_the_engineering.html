    <h1>
       The Engineering Design Process
    </h1>
    <p>
       The <span class="b">engineering design process</span> is the application of math, science,
      and technology to create a system, component, or process that meets a human need.
    </p>
    <p>
       In practice, engineering design is really just a specialized form of <span class="b">problem
      solving</span>. Consider the simple 7-step problem-solving process below:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Identify the problem</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Define the problem</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Develop alternative solutions</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Analyze and compare alternative solutions</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Select the best alternative</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Implement the solution</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Evaluate the results</span>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="btop">
       When civil engineers design a bridge, they typically use this same process:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Identify the problem.</span> A <object classid=
        "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
          <param name="content" value="glos_client.html">
          <param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
          <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
          <param name="text" value="client">
          <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        </object> hires a team of engineers to design a highway bridge that will cross a river.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Define the problem.</span> The engineers investigate the proposed site and
        work with the client to determine exactly what the functional requirements of the bridge
        will be. Where will the bridge be located? How many lanes of traffic are required? What are
        the characteristics of the river--width, depth, current velocity? Is the river used by
        ships? If so, how wide a navigable channel and how much overhead clearance do the vessels
        need? Who owns the land on either side of the river? What sort of soil and rock are located
        there? The engineers also determine if there are any aesthetic requirements for the
        structure and, perhaps most importantly, they find out how much money the client is willing
        to pay for the new bridge--the project budget.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Develop alternative solutions.</span> The engineers develop several
        alternative <span class="i">concept designs</span> for the new bridge--perhaps a truss, an
        arch, and a suspension bridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Analyze and compare alternative solutions.</span> The engineers analyze
        each design alternative to determine its strengths and weaknesses, with respect to the
        project requirements and constraints identified in Step 2 above. They also consider the
        environmental impact and constructibility of each proposed option.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Select the best alternative.</span> After carefully analyzing all of the
        alternatives, the engineers select the one that best satisfies the project requirements.
        They present this selection as a recommendation to the client, who makes the final
        decision.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Implement the solution.</span> Once the client has approved the concept
        design, the team completes the final design, prepares plans and specifications, and hands
        them over to a construction contractor to build.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Evaluate the results.</span> At the end of the project, the engineers
        evaluate the completed structure. They identify aspects of the project that went well and
        aspects that could be improved. Ultimately these observations help to improve the quality
        of future projects.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="btop">
       When you design a bridge with the <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer
      2016</span>, you should also follow this same process.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Identify the problem.</span> Your project is to design a <a href=
        "hlp_trusses_and.html">truss bridge</a> to carry a four-lane highway across a river.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Define the problem.</span> To fully define and understand the problem, you
        should carefully read the <a href="hlp_design_specifications.html">Design
        Specifications</a> and familiarize with the characteristics of the project site.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Develop alternative solutions.</span> To achieve a high-quality design, you
        will need to investigate several different <a href="hlp_select_project.html">site
        configurations</a> and <a href="hlp_truss_configuration.html">truss configurations</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Analyze and compare alternative solutions.</span> Optimize each alternative
        configuration for minimum cost, then compare the results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Select the best alternative.</span> Select the alternative that costs the
        least, while still passing the <object classid=

      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Implement the solution.</span> Finalize your design, and <a href=
        "hlp_record_design.html">record it</a> by saving it to disk, printing a drawing of it, and
        printing a copy of the load test results. If you would like to build and test a cardboard
        model of your design, check out our Learning Activities Manual, now available for free from
        our website, <span class="u">http://bridgecontest.org/resources/file-folder-bridges</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="b">Evaluate the results.</span> Think about what you learned about the design
        process and about structural behavior as you designed your bridge. Then apply these lessons
        to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your next design.
