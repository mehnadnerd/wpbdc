<h1>Trusses and Truss Bridges</h1>
<h2>What is a Truss?</h2>
<p>A truss is an arrangement of structural <object classid=
"java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer"><param name="content" value=
"glos_members.html">
<param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
<param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
<param name="text" value="members">
<param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup"></object> that are connected
together to form a rigid framework. In most trusses, members are arranged in
interconnected triangles, as shown in the example below:</p>
<p class="in1"><img border="0" alt="What is a Truss?" src=
"images/dwarren.png"></p>
<p>As a result of this configuration, truss members carry load primarily in
axial <object classid=
"java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer"><param name="content" value=
"glos_tension.html">
<param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
<param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
<param name="text" value="tension">
<param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup"></object> and
<object classid="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer"><param name=
"content" value="glos_compression.html">
<param name="viewerSize" value="600,160">
<param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
<param name="text" value="compression">
<param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup"></object>. Because they are
very rigid and they carry load efficiently, trusses are able to

<param name="text" value="span">
<param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup"></object> large distances
with a minimum of material.</p>
<h2>Truss Bridges</h2>
<p>Trusses have been used extensively in bridges since the early 19th Century.
Early truss bridges were made of wood. The classic American covered bridges are
all trusses, though the wooden truss members are covered by walls and a roof,
for protection from the elements. Later truss bridges were made of cast iron
and wrought iron. Most modern trusses are made of structural steel. Truss
bridges can be found in many different <a href=
"hlp_standard_truss.html">configurations,</a> but virtually all have the same
basic <a href="hlp_component_parts.html">component parts.</a></p>
<p>There are many other types of bridges. These include beam bridges, arches,
suspension bridges, and cable-stayed bridges.</p>
