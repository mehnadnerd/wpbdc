       The <span class="f4c14">Bridge Designer 2016</span> allows you to use three
      different <span class="b">materials</span> in your design:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Carbon steel. This is the most common grade of structural steel, composed primarily of iron
        and about 0.26% carbon.
      </li>
      <li>
        High-Strength Low-Alloy steel. This increasingly popular structural steel is similar to
        carbon steel but significantly stronger. The higher strength is attained from small amounts
        of manganese, columbium, vanadium, and other alloying elements added during the
        manufacturing process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quenched and Tempered Low-Alloy Steel. This very high-strength steel is similar to
        high-strength low-alloy steel, but its strength is further increased through a special
        heat-treating process.
      </li>
    </ol>

       Notes and Tips
    </h2>
    <p>
       Which material is the best choice for a given structural design? The answer depends largely
      on the relative importance of cost and strength (yield stress) in the design. Carbon steel is
      the least expensive of the three alternatives, but it also has the lowest strength.
      High-strength low-alloy steel is somewhat more expensive but about 40% stronger than carbon
      steel. Quenched and tempered low-alloy steel is both the strongest and most expensive of the
      three. All three materials have approximately the same <a href=
      "hlp_material_densities.html">density</a> and <object classid=
      "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">

      </object>.
    </p>
    <p>
       The "best" material often varies from structure to structure, and a given design may use
      more than one material. You'll need to do some experimenting to determine which materials are
      best for your design.
