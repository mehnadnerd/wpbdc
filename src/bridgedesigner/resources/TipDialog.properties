tip01.tipText=<html>The <b>Bridge Designer, Second Edition</b> has improved support for computers with limited graphics capability. Check out Help on the <b>Test</b>, <b>Use Old-Style Graphics</b> menu checkbox.</html>
tip02.tipText=<html>The <b>Second Edition</b> of the <b>Bridge Designer</b> has some cool new features. Select the <b>Help</b> menu and then <b>What's New?</b> to see what we mean!</html>
tip03.tipText=<html><b>West Point, the U.S. Military Academy</b> was the first school in the U.S. to offer a formal program of instruction in engineering. The Bridge Designer began as a faculty project to celebrate the Military Academy's bicentennial in 2002.</html>
tip04.tipText=<html>You can select a member in two different ways: (1) click the member itself on the <b>Drawing Board</b>, or (2) click the corresponding entry on the <b>Member List</b> on the right-hand side of your screen.</html>
tip05.tipText=<html>You can select several members by holding down the <b>Ctrl</b> key or by dragging the mouse. Use this technique to change the properties of several members simultaneously.</html>
tip06.tipText=<html>You can sort the <b>Member List</b> by member number, by member properties, or by load test results.  Just click the button at the top of the appropriate column in the list.</html>
tip07.tipText=<html>You can select several members simultaneously by dragging a box around them with the mouse.</html>
tip08.tipText=<html>To speed up the design process, you can run the <b>Load Test</b> without displaying the animation. Click the <b>Test</b> menu, then uncheck <b>Show Animation</b>.</html>
tip09.tipText=<html>There are two ways to delete a joint or member: (1) select the object(s) you want to delete, then click the <b>Delete</b> button on the <b>Toolbar</b>; or (2) click the <b>Erase tool</b> on the <b>Tools</b> palette, then click the object you want to delete.</html>
tip10.tipText=<html>You can use the <b>Go Back</b> button to return to a previous design iteration.</html>
tip11.tipText=<html>In the load test animation, deflections of the bridge are exaggerated by a factor of 10 to help you better visualize how a truss carries load.  Real bridges don't bend this much!</html>
tip12.tipText=<html>You can display the <b>Load Test</b> animation without exaggerated deflections, without color changes in the members, and without various elements of the background.  Click the drop arrow on the <b>Animation Controls</b> and clear the corresponding check box.</html>
tip13.tipText=<html>For a given weight and type of material, hollow tubes are somewhat more expensive than solid bars, but tubes carry compressive member forces much more efficiently.  Therefore, it is generally better to use tubes for compression members.</html>
tip14.tipText=<html>For a given weight and type of material, hollow tubes and solid bars carry tensile member forces with equal efficiency.  Since tubes are somewhat more expensive than bars, it is generally better to use solid bars for tension members.</html>
tip15.tipText=<html>In the <b>Load Test</b> animation, tension members turn blue, and compression members turn red.  The intensity of the color is directly proportional to the intensity of loading.</html>
tip16.tipText=<html>In the <b>Load Test</b> animation, you can see what it's like to ride in the truck while crossing a successful bridge. Click the faded truck icon and drag the mouse to look around you.</html>
tip17.tipText=<html>If you make a mistake while creating or editing your structural model, just click the <b>Undo</b> button. You can undo your undo with the <b>Redo</b> button.</html>
tip18.tipText=<html>The cost of your bridge is the sum of four parts: (1) the material cost, (2) the connection cost, (3) the product cost, and (4) the site cost.  Click the <b>Report</b> menu and the <b>Cost Calculations</b> to see how the total is computed.</html>
tip19.tipText=<html>If you are just learning how to use the <b>Bridge Designer</b>, load a <b>Standard Truss Template</b> to show you how to position joints and members to create a stable structural model.</html>
tip20.tipText=<html>On the <b>Drawing Board</b> are 3 labels for the <b>Floor Beams</b>, <b>Concrete Deck</b>, and <b>Asphalt Road Surface</b>. If they cover part of your structural model, you can drag them out of the way with your mouse.</html>
tip21.tipText=<html>The <b>Delete</b> key on your keyboard performs exactly the same function as the <b>Delete</b> button on the <b>Toolbar</b>.</html>
tip22.tipText=<html>You can move a joint by dragging it with the mouse.</html>
tip23.tipText=<html>You can move a joint by selecting it and then pressing the appropriate arrow key on your keyboard.</html>
tip24.tipText=<html>The drawing grid has three different resolutions. Use the high-resolution grid to make small adjustments to the position of joints in your structural model.</html>
tip25.tipText=<html>If you want to ensure that the shape of your structural model is symmetrical, switch on the <b>Symmetry Guides</b>.</html>
